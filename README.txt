How To Use It
--------------
Simply double click the JAR and select the .tsv file you want to work with.
Then you can choose an algorithm to run or use the default.
You can also view several lists we made in case you wanted more information about projects and 
students in your file.

---------------
Note on Energy
---------------
If you've run the program to get a mapping you would have seen a figure called "energy".
This calculated using energy = (The rank of the project assigned + 1)*(The rank of the project assigned + 1)
For the rank if someone were to get their first choice the ranking would be 1 so their energy would be 4.
